# ML_IndoorLocalization
Indoor GPS is unreliable due to signal loss in buildings. This project uses machine learning on Wi-Fi signal data to improve indoor localization. By testing and comparing models, it identifies approaches that enhance accuracy for navigation, assistive tech, and smart facilities.
